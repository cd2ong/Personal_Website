                <div id="answer1" class="content">
                    <p style="text-align:left; margin: 20px 40px 20px 40px;">I graduated university with a bachelors of applied science and one of the most common questions asked by interviewers upon seeing my resume is, "Why is he applying to a UX/UI design job as an engineering graduate?" </p>
                    <p style="text-align:left; margin: 0px 40px 20px 40px;">The reason that I apply to UX/UI design jobs is because the Systems Design Engineering program at the Unviersity of Waterloo focuses on much more than your typical STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) program. Systems Design focuses on a more holistic view of engineering which incorporates UX/UI design concepts within the engineering design process. Over my five year degree, I was given many opportunities in the work force and in class projects to develop my UX/UI skills. This exposure taught me that I have a passion for UX/UI development and that is why I am choosing to pursue this field of work.</p>

                <div id="answer2" class="content">
                    <p style="text-align:left; margin: 20px 40px 20px 40px;">The next question that employers have when looking over my resume is, "What exactly does Systems Design Engineering involve?" </p>
                    <p style="text-align:left; margin: 0px 40px 20px 40px;"> Going back to my 101 class in my first term at the University of Waterloo, the instructor told us the story of "the blind men and the elephant" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant" >See the wikipedia page</a>). In the story it is explained that multiple blind men examined different parts of an elephant. Each blind man comes to a different conclusion on what the elephant must be based upon what they inspected. The instructor then proceeded to explain that Systems Design Engineering was a broad engineering discipline that took a holistic approach. Instead of examining each part separately, Systems Design looks at the big picture (the whole elephant) and how the various parts interact. This approach was ideal to learning valuable skills in full stack development and gave me the skills to communicate effectively with various demographics (everyone from engineers to programmers to graphic designers.)</p>
